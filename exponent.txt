### Database Schema and Initialization

The application uses a well-structured PostgreSQL database managed through Prisma ORM and Supabase with the following components:

1. Core Models (Prisma Schema)

1. User Model
   ```prisma
   model User {
     id            String    @id @default(cuid())
     name          String?
     email         String    @unique
     emailVerified DateTime?
     image         String?
     password      String
     createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
     updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
     activities    Activity[]
     achievements  Achievement[]
   }
   ```

2. Initial Data Setup
   - Predefined challenges with varying requirements:
     * Daily Logger (3 activities per day)
     * Photo Collector (5 photos per week)
     * Milestone Master (3 developmental milestones)
   - Achievement system initialization:
     * First Steps (First activity logged)
     * Consistency Champion (7-day streak)
     * Data Pioneer (Research contribution)

3. Database Tables Structure
   - profiles: User profile management
   - activities: Activity tracking with JSON metadata
   - points: Gamification point tracking
   - achievements: User achievement tracking
   - streaks: User engagement tracking
   - challenges: Community challenges
   - user_challenges: Challenge progress tracking

4. Activity Model
   ```prisma
   model Activity {
     id        String   @id @default(cuid())
     type      String
     date      DateTime @default(now())
     details   Json?
     userId    String
     user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

3. Achievement Model
   ```prisma
   model Achievement {
     id          String   @id @default(cuid())
     title       String
     description String
     date        DateTime @default(now())
     userId      String
     user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

   {
     title: string
     description: string
     type: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'special'
     points_reward: number
     requirements: {
       type: string
       target: number
       activity_types?: string[]
       timeframe?: string
     }
     metadata: {
       icon: string
       category: string
     }
   }
   ```

3. Achievement System
   ```typescript
   {
     type: 'engagement' | 'streak' | 'contribution'
     name: string
     description: string
     points: number
     metadata: {
       icon: string
